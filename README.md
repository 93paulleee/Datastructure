##### 1. Sparse Matrix
-> Most of the matrix is filled with zeros.
##### 2. Stack
->
In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:

>push, which adds an element to the collection, and
>pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed

##### 3. Queue
->
Like Stack, Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).  A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.

>Enqueue: Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
>Dequeue: Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed. If the >queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
>Front: Get the front item from queue.
>Rear: Get the last item from queue.
